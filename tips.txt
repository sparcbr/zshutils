" There  is an optimisation for substitutions of the form =(<<<arg), where arg is a single-word argument to the here-string redirection <<<.  This form produces a file name containing  the  value  of arg  after  any  substitutions  have  been performed.  This is handled entirely within the current shell.  This is effectively the reverse of the special form $(<arg) which treats arg as a file name and replaces it with the file's contents."
